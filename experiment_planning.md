# Now
Currently working with 5 utility edge-ai functions and 1 of the utility function will have all four types of attacks. This is to test the pipeline and scale it later.

# Target 
The target is to have 25 utility edge-ai functions, and 4 attacks types. These attacks are backed by [academic research](https://sites.google.com/view/pypiempircal) on PyPi python ecosystem. These attack types are
1. Information stealing
1. Code execution (e.g. remote shell)
1. Command execution
1. Unauthorized file operation

5 of the utility function will have each of the attack types as compromised function giving 20 compromised functions. So, we have 25 benign, and 20 compromised functions.
